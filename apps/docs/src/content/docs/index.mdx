## Why this handbook exists

S.T.E.P.S serves families navigating Universal Credit, fluctuating income, debt, and neurodiversity.
Every technical decision must preserve calm, uphold the ethical charter, and respect UK financial rules.
This handbook keeps those obligations visible so no feature, refactor, or release drifts away from the
governance documents living in `/funadocs`.

## Quick entry points

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Team onboarding" icon="pencil" href="/guides/getting-started/">
		Understand the working agreement, required reading order, and how to request reviews aligned with
		the Ethical Product Charter.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Architecture & governance" icon="setting" href="/guides/architecture-optimization/">
		See the shared package strategy, resilience pillars, and how Decision Log + Governance Matrix tie every
		change to specific safeguards.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Governance matrix" icon="open-book" href="/reference/governance-matrix/">
		Trace each `/funadocs` document to concrete engineering and process checks before raising a PR or ADR.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Recovery & crisis playbook" icon="document">
		Follow deterministic flows for “Something went wrong” experiences so recovery always remains calmer than avoidance.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Phase gates & feature flags" icon="add-document">
		Validate that work matches the Phased Roadmap & Evolution Plan and that higher-phase features stay optional.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Tooling & Bun workflow" icon="setting">
		Use `bun install` and workspace-aware scripts for every dependency, lint task, or test to keep the supply chain predictable.

## Operating principles

- **Choose calm.** Prefer slower delivery over stress-inducing shortcuts.
- **Make uncertainty explicit.** When data is approximate, say so and link to the UK Financial Reality Rules.
- **Document before coding.** Capture intent via the Decision Log template referencing the Governance Matrix.
- **Protect recovery paths.** Any change touching crisis flows requires behavioural safety review and tone validation.
- **Own the outcome.** If a safeguard is missing, add it instead of deferring responsibility.
