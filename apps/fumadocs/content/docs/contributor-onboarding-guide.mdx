## 1. Purpose

Helps contributors understand why S.T.E.P.S exists, who it serves, how decisions are made, what matters most, and what must never be compromised. S.T.E.P.S is values-led. If this guide does not resonate, this project may not be the right fit—and that’s okay.

## 2. What You Are Working On

S.T.E.P.S is a calm, recovery-first financial planning app for UK households—especially people on Universal Credit, families with low or fluctuating income, neurodiverse users (ADHD/PTSD/anxiety), and people living with debt stress. Assume every user arrives overwhelmed, ashamed, avoiding money, and afraid of making things worse. Design as if the user is having a bad day.

## 3. What Makes S.T.E.P.S Different

Most financial products optimise for engagement, growth, compliance, and monetisation. We optimise for safety, clarity, dignity, recovery, and trust over time. Expect slower decisions, fewer features, more restraint, and more explanation. We do not “ship fast and break things”; we build something people trust when life goes wrong.

## 4. Required Reading

Before contributing, read in order:

1. Founding Vision & Purpose
2. Ethical Product Charter
3. Product Overview & Scope
4. Feature Inventory (Master List)
5. Recovery & Crisis Design Spec
6. UX Principles & Tone of Voice
7. UK Financial Reality Rules
8. Phased Roadmap & Evolution Plan
9. Behavioural Safety Rules
10. Decision Log (Template & Rules)

These documents outrank personal preference, industry norms, and “best practices.” If something feels inconsistent, raise it immediately.

## 5. How Decisions Are Made

Authority alone is insufficient. Decisions are documented, justified, and reviewed against ethics and safety. Any change affecting user stress, recovery flows, monetisation, behavioural nudges, or data usage must pass through the Decision Log. Correct beats fast.

## 6. Proposing Changes

When pitching an idea, include:

- Problem it solves.
- Who benefits.
- Which S.T.E.P.S step it supports.
- Which roadmap phase it belongs to.
- Potential risks or harm.
- Alignment references.

Ideas framed as “this boosts engagement” or “users expect this” without ethical context will be challenged.

## 7. Behaviour & Design Expectations

Assume users are tired, stressed, possibly neurodiverse, and avoiding finances. Reduce cognitive load, prefer clarity, avoid urgency, explain changes, and never shame. If it would feel harsh during a bad week, it is wrong.

## 8. Non-Negotiables

Never introduce dark patterns, pressure-based nudges, paywalled help, shame language, hidden safe options, monetisation prompts during crisis flows, or dismiss vulnerability concerns. Escalate if pressured to do otherwise.

## 9. Challenging Decisions

Challenge decisions that feel unsafe, increase pressure, conflict with the charter, or appear exploitative. Disagreement is encouraged; silence is dangerous.

## 10. Contributor Success Criteria

You are not measured by speed, feature count, or engagement metrics alone. You are evaluated on safety, clarity, restraint, user trust, and values alignment. Doing less can be better.

## 11. When Unsure

Pause, re-read the documents, ask questions, choose the calmer option. Caution has no penalty.

## 12. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S serves people at vulnerable moments. Every decision may affect rent, mental health, or family stability. We take that responsibility seriously. If you believe in humane systems, welcome. If not, this isn’t the right space—and that’s okay.
