Survive Debt · Take Control · Establish Wealth · Protect Family · Secure Legacy

## 1. Purpose

This document prevents scope creep, keeps S.T.E.P.S aligned with its founding vision, gives contributors clear boundaries, and ensures the product never drifts into banking, fintech, or credit territory. If a feature does not fit this scope, it does not ship.

## 2. What S.T.E.P.S Is

A calm, UK-focused financial planning and debt recovery app that helps households understand income timing, track spending, see what is safe, prioritise essentials, recover when things go wrong, and make steady progress without shame. It is designed first for Universal Credit households, low or fluctuating incomes, families under pressure, and neurodiverse users.

## 3. Core Problems Solved

Practical: irregular income schedules, weekend/bank holiday shifts, opaque UC rules, inconsistent rent handling, unclear debt priorities, uncertainty about safe spend. Emotional: panic after missed payments, avoidance due to shame, overwhelm from numbers, fear of banking apps, feeling punished by “helpful” tools. S.T.E.P.S addresses both.

## 4. What S.T.E.P.S Is Not

It is not a bank, bank-account replacement, credit score tool, lending platform, punitive budgeting app, financial advice service, or substitute for regulated debt advice. S.T.E.P.S does not hold or move money, initiate payments, force decisions, or guarantee outcomes. It supports decisions; it never makes them for users.

## 5. Product Pillars

- **Visibility:** Users can see every inflow/outflow, timing, coverage, and risk. Confusion equals failure.
- **Safety:** Reduce panic, prevent spirals, encourage early intervention, make recovery easier than avoidance with calm language and predictable behaviour.
- **Control:** Nothing happens without consent, changes are explained, options are offered. Agency is sacred.
- **Progress:** Emphasise steady, forgiving progress—consistency over intensity, direction over speed, recovery over perfection.

## 6. Core Feature Categories (In Scope)

### 6.3 Calendar-Based Cashflow

### 6.6 Recovery & Crisis Support

“Something went wrong” flows, de-escalation, letter storage, phone-support prompts, crisis mode with reduced cognitive load.

## 7. Explicitly Out of Scope

Mandatory open banking, automated transaction categorisation, payment initiation, credit offers, advertising, affiliate marketing, credit score monitoring, aggressive optimisation, automated enforcement. These exclusions protect users and focus.

## 8. Success Criteria

Users feel safe opening the app, miss fewer essential payments, understand finances, reduce debt balances, avoid less, and use recovery flows without shame. Stress-inducing metrics are not success indicators.

## 9. Relationship to Other Documents

Implements the Founding Vision & Purpose, constrained by the Ethical Product Charter, and sets boundaries for the Feature Inventory, Roadmap, and UX principles. If conflicts arise, this scope holds unless overridden by ethical red lines.

## 10. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S provides clarity, safety, and progress—not control, judgment, or pressure. The scope stays narrow so the app excels at a focused mission. Any expansion must prove it preserves calm, dignity, and trust.
