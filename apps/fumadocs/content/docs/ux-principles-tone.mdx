## 1. Purpose

Defines how S.T.E.P.S feels to use so that the app stays safe, supportive, and non-shaming for tired, stressed, and neurodiverse users. If something works technically but feels wrong, this document wins.

## 2. Core UX Philosophy

Users arrive overwhelmed; therefore clarity beats cleverness, calm beats urgency, and understanding beats efficiency. The app must feel like a steady, supportive guide—never a dashboard, boss, or judge.

## 3. Tone of Voice

### 3.1 Overall Tone

Calm, human, plain-English, non-judgemental, supportive, reassuring, and emotionally neutral. “Someone who wants to help, not enforce compliance.”

### 3.2 Preferred Language

Examples: “Let’s look at this together,” “It looks like…,” “You can choose to…,” “This might help,” “Nothing urgent right now,” “That’s okay,” “Here’s what we know.” Focus on information and options.

### 3.3 Prohibited Language

Never use “You should/must,” “Failure,” “Overspent,” “Missed target,” “Non-compliant,” “Warning,” “Urgent” (unless legally required), red countdown timers, or shame-based comparisons. No lectures or moral framing.

## 4. Writing Style Rules

### 4.1 Plain English First

Avoid jargon/acronyms (or explain them), keep copy skimmable, use short sentences.

### 4.2 Explain Why

Whenever something changes, state what changed, why, and what (if anything) the user needs to do. Surprises raise anxiety.

### 4.3 One Idea per Screen

Screens ask one question, decision, or data point. Minimal numbers, minimal cognitive load.

## 5. Visual & Interaction Principles

### 5.1 Colour & Safety

Avoid red unless unavoidable; prefer blues/greens/neutrals, no flashing, aggressive contrast, or alarm icons. Visual design must calm.

### 5.2 Motion & Feedback

Subtle animations only. No celebrations for basic actions, no failure animations. Feedback should be gentle and informative.

### 5.3 Consistency Over Novelty

Predictable behaviour and responses; surprise interactions erode safety.

## 6. Neurodiverse Support

Default design choices: minimal clutter, clear hierarchy, obvious next steps, no time pressure, no punishment for disengagement, clear exits from flows. Avoid infinite scrolling, hidden gestures, forced completion, and gamified urgency.

## 7. Notifications & Alerts

### 7.1 Rules

Informative, neutral tone; never blaming; no aggressive stacking. Example: “Just a heads-up: a payment is coming up tomorrow.” Not: “You’re about to miss a payment!”

### 7.2 Reducing Noise

When stress indicators appear, reduce notification frequency, suppress non-essential nudges, prioritise calm. Silence can be support.

## 8. Gamification & Motivation

Encouragement without pressure, optional participation, cosmetic rewards only. Streaks never punish, breaks are neutral, recovery actions count as positive. Gamification must never trigger guilt or imply failure.

## 9. Handling Mistakes & Errors

Apologise gently if needed, explain what happened, what happens next, and never imply blame. Example: “Something didn’t load properly. Nothing’s changed — please try again.”

## 10. Accessibility & Inclusion

Readable fonts, clear contrast, simple language, predictable navigation, inclusive examples. Accessibility is mandatory.

## 11. AI & Automated Messaging

Any AI-generated content must follow these tone rules, sound human, avoid authority, explain uncertainty, and remain editable. AI assists; it never instructs.

## 12. Governance

Any UX change must be checked against this document. If a design increases stress, adds urgency, removes control, or introduces shame, it must change or be removed.

## 13. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S meets people where they are. If the app ever feels cold, rushed, or judgemental, something is wrong. We are here to make money feel less frightening, not to judge financial performance.
