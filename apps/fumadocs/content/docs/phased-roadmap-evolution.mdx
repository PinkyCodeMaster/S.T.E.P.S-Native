description: Ethical evolution framework outlining how S.T.E.P.S grows across phases.

Survive Debt · Take Control · Establish Wealth · Protect Family · Secure Legacy

## 1. Purpose

Defines how S.T.E.P.S evolves responsibly: preventing premature features, ensuring strong foundations, protecting users from optimisation pressure, and keeping alignment with founding values. This is an evolution framework, not a delivery schedule. Features stay in phase unless the criteria to advance are met.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- Stability before speed.
- Understanding before optimisation.
- Recovery before performance.
- Power remains optional; progression is never forced.
- Trust is earned, not assumed.

No phase exists solely to chase growth.

## 3. Phase Definitions

Phases reflect shifts in user capability and confidence—not feature counts.

- **Phase 1:** Reduce panic, restore clarity.
- **Phase 2:** Build consistency and confidence.
- **Phase 3:** Enable faster progress through choice.
- **Phase 4:** Extend impact responsibly.

Users do not graduate; later-phase features are optional.

## 4. Phase 1 — MVP (Survive Debt · Take Control)

**Goal:** Help users stop panicking, stop missing essentials, and clearly understand finances. Phase 1 must stand alone.

**Capabilities**

- **Core Visibility:** Calendar-first cashflow, income vs expense clarity, safe-to-spend calculation, UK payment timing.
- **Income Support:** Wages, UC, Child Benefit, Child Maintenance, UC housing handling, UC taper estimation.
- **Expenses & Bills:** Essential vs discretionary, rent with UC logic, service charges/ground rent, effective-dated changes.
- **Debt Support:** Full debt list, minimum payments, debt snowball, CCJ priority override.
- **Emergency Funds:** Starter fund, bare-minimum essentials calculator, optional six-month guidance.
- **Recovery & Crisis:** “Something went wrong” entry, missed payment flows, letter storage, phone prompts, crisis mode.

**Success Criteria**

Users feel safe opening the app, avoid less, miss fewer essentials, understand money flow, and use recovery tools. If not, Phase 2 cannot begin.

## 5. Phase 2 — Stability & Confidence (Take Control Deepened)

**Goal:** Build consistency, reduce surprises, and grow confidence without pressure.

**Capabilities**

- **Budget Stability:** Rollover budgets, sinking funds.
- **Awareness:** Subscription reminders, free trial alerts, UC change warnings.
- **Behavioural Support:** Gentle streaks, cosmetic progress, positive reinforcement.

**Success Criteria**

Greater predictability, fewer “something went wrong” moments, higher planning confidence, no stress spike. If engagement feels pressured, rethink or remove features.

## 6. Phase 3 — Acceleration & Education (Establish Wealth · Protect Family)

**Goal:** Help stable users reduce debt faster and make informed choices. Participation is optional.

**Capabilities**

- **Optimisation (Advisory):** Bill date optimisation suggestions, manual cashflow smoothing.
- **Income Intelligence:** Tax/NI estimates, hourly vs salaried modelling, overtime planning.
- **Debt Strategy Options:** Avalanche method, manual prioritisation, side-by-side comparisons.
- **Guided Education:** Plain-English explainers, AI-assisted letter drafting (editable), affordability communication support.

**Success Criteria**

Optional users see faster reduction and improved understanding without added overwhelm. Optimisation must stay optional and explainable; pressure equals failure.

## 7. Phase 4 — Ecosystem & Legacy (Secure Legacy)

**Goal:** Extend impact responsibly only after trust, governance, and safeguards are proven.

**Capabilities (Conditional)**

- **Optional Integrations:** Read-only open banking with manual override.
- **Ethical Partnerships:** Cost-saving offers, no credit pushing, no affiliate pressure, ethics review required.
- **Creditor Collaboration:** Share affordability summaries, cooperative payment planning, enforcement avoidance tools.
- **Ethical Consolidation:** Fixed principal, no interest, capped service costs, external oversight, strong hardship protections.

Phase 4 must never compromise dignity, autonomy, or recovery-first principles.

## 8. Deferred/Conditional Features

- Payment initiation.
- Automated enforcement.
- Credit scoring.
- Marketing-driven offers.

These require separate ethical review, documented justification, and alignment with prior documents before consideration.

## 9. Phase Transition Rules

Advancing phases requires meeting success criteria, reviewing user feedback, gaining ethical sign-off, and confirming no unresolved harm indicators. Phases are checkpoints, not deadlines.

## 10. Relationship to Other Documents

Implements the Founding Vision, constrained by the Ethical Product Charter, draws from the Feature Inventory, respects Recovery & UX rules, and obeys UK Financial Reality Rules. When conflicts arise, ethics and recovery dominate.

## 11. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S grows by earning trust—not by racing through features. Each phase serves users at the pace their lives allow. Progress is measured in stability, not speed.
