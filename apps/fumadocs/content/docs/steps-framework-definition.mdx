## Survive Debt

Stabilise the moment. Capture debts, letters, UC changes, and immediate threats. Provide scripts, crisis checklists, and breathing cues.

## Take Control

Introduce routines: calendar nudges, letter uploads, UC payment previews, and grounded to-do lists that match real energy levels.

## Establish Wealth

Shift from reactive to proactive. Build sinking funds, negotiate payment plans, and celebrate micro-wins without bragging or pressure.

## Protect Family

Codify safeguards: benefits checks, rent buffers, school expenses, guardianship prompts. Provide sharing features with trusted allies.

## Secure Legacy

Long-term planning: wills, long-term savings, building intergenerational calm. Only unlocked when user signals readiness; never forced.

## Movement Between Steps

- Steps are guides, not gates. Users can focus on a single module or oscillate.
- Emotional readiness signals (self-reported calm) influence recommended step, not strictly numeric progress.
- Regression is normal; the app normalises moving back to Survive when life events hit.
