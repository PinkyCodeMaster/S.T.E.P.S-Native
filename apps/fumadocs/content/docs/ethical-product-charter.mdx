title: Ethical Product Charter
description: Red lines that protect S.T.E.P.S users, product, and founders.

For S.T.E.P.S — Survive Debt. Take Control. Establish Wealth. Protect Family. Secure Legacy.

## 1. Purpose of This Charter

This charter defines the non-negotiable ethical boundaries of S.T.E.P.S. It protects users in vulnerable situations, preserves product integrity, shields contributors from harmful incentives, and defends the founder from pressure or rationalisation. If any feature, decision, partnership, or revenue idea conflicts with this charter, it does not proceed. This document overrides convenience, speed, and commercial pressure.

## 2. Our Ethical Foundation

1. **Vulnerability is not weakness.** Financial stress, mental health struggles, and benefit dependency are not failures.
2. **Support must never be conditional.** Help is not withheld, gated, or manipulated.
3. **Power must be constrained.** No person or entity can wield unchecked authority, even with good intentions.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Red Lines

### 3.1 Monetisation

S.T.E.P.S will never lock essential help behind paywalls, charge to understand situations, sell or push debt/credit products, profit from prolonged debt, introduce interest-based fees in core recovery, or obscure true costs. Any paid offering must be optional, transparent, never worsen finances, and never use fear or urgency.

### 3.2 Behaviour & UX

No shaming, red alerts, countdown timers, punitive streaks, or framing mistakes as failures. We will never use dark patterns, guilt, scarcity, or comparisons to manipulate behaviour. Recovery must always be easier than avoidance.

### 3.3 Data & Privacy

S.T.E.P.S will never sell data, share it without explicit consent, require bank integrations to access help, use financial data for advertising, track behaviour beyond what support requires, or let AI make financial decisions without oversight. User data exists solely to help the user.

### 3.4 Vulnerability & Safeguarding

We will never treat vulnerability as non-compliance, escalate enforcement due to crises, pressure users during distress, remove support because someone is struggling, or use authority to coerce behaviour. Vulnerability increases our obligation to care.

## 4. Commitments

### 4.1 Universal Access to Help

Planning tools, recovery flows, explanations, guidance, and clarity remain accessible to all users without subscriptions or upgrades.

### 4.2 Transparency by Default

We explain why numbers change, how decisions are made, disclose costs upfront, surface assumptions, and never hide trade-offs. Surprise indicates system failure.

### 4.3 Calm First, Optimisation Later

Stability, understanding, and recovery trump speed. Optimisation features must be optional, explainable, and stress-reducing.

### 4.4 Recovery Is Positive

Using recovery tools is responsible and proactive. Mistakes never erase progress.

## 5. Constraints on Power & Authority

### 5.1 Separation of Roles

No single individual decides enforcement outcomes. There are no discretionary punishments or “good/bad user” labels. Harmful decisions must be rule-based, transparent, and reviewable.

### 5.2 Enforcement as Last Resort

If enforcement features ever appear, they must follow independent rules, consider vulnerability, prioritise resolution, and avoid automatic triggers. Enforcement signals a system failure, not a product capability.

## 6. Ethical Automation & AI

Automation and AI may only explain, suggest, summarise, or reduce cognitive load. They must never pressure users, override agency, obscure consequences, or remove human judgment from high-risk situations. Users must understand actions, retain final say, and opt out.

## 7. Handling Growth Pressure

Growth may tempt faster monetisation, aggressive optimisation, or scope creep. This charter exists to refuse success that compromises dignity. Growth that harms users equals failure.

## 8. Accountability & Review

The charter stays accessible to everyone, referenced in major decisions, and revisited rarely. Any conflicting proposal requires a written justification, explanation of the challenged red line, and a decision record.

## 9. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S exists because financial power over vulnerable people demands restraint, humility, and care. This charter is binding. If S.T.E.P.S violates it, the product loses its right to exist in its current form.
