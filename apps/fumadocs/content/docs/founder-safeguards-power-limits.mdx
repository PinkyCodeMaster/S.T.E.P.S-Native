## 1. Purpose

Defines explicit limits on founder power to protect users, prevent product drift, reduce pressure on the founder, and maintain ethical continuity. This is about responsibility, not mistrust.

## 2. Foundational Principle

No single person—founder included—should hold unchecked power over financially vulnerable users. Good intentions are insufficient; structures must prevent harm even if intentions change.

## 3. Founder Authority

The founder can define and defend the vision, uphold the Ethical Product Charter, set strategy within scope, approve/reject features based on documented criteria, and act as steward of user trust—within the constraints of this document.

## 4. Explicit Limits

The founder must never unilaterally change ethical red lines, introduce exploitative monetisation, alter recovery/crisis flows without review, weaken behavioural safety, use user data for personal/external gain, or override safeguards during stress or financial pressure. Intent does not grant exceptions.

## 5. Oversight-Required Decisions

The following require additional safeguards (cooling-off periods, external advice, ethical review, Decision Log reference):

- Introduce paid features.
- Change data usage or privacy rules.
- Add behavioural nudges or pressure mechanics.
- Introduce AI-driven recommendations.
- Integrate open banking.
- Explore debt consolidation or enforcement features.

No same-day approvals for high-risk areas.

## 6. Cooling-Off Periods

Mandatory delays for decisions impacting finances, vulnerability, trust, or power balance:

- 72 hours for monetisation changes.
- 1 week for data or AI changes.
- 2 weeks for enforcement or consolidation ideas.

Pauses reduce reactive judgement.

## 7. External Accountability

As S.T.E.P.S grows, include independent advisors, ethics reviewers, lived-experience reps, or regulatory consultation. Their role is to challenge, not rubber-stamp. Treat dissent as signal.

## 8. Conflict of Interest Rules

The founder must disclose financial interests intersecting with decisions, recuse when personal gain is possible, and avoid decisions that primarily benefit themselves. If benefits overlap, user benefit must dominate.

## 9. Founder Wellbeing Safeguards

During financial stress, burnout, external pressure, or emotional strain, the founder must slow decision-making, lean on documentation, avoid major changes, and prioritise stability. Burnout increases risk.

## 10. Succession & Continuity

Ethics cannot collapse if the founder steps back. Ensure documentation-first decisions, clear governance, no hidden knowledge, and accessible decision history so leadership changes do not erode standards.

## 11. Emergency Powers

In rare legal, security, or safety emergencies, the founder may act swiftly to protect data, prevent harm, or comply with lawful orders. Actions must be logged, reviewed, and reversed if overreaching. Emergency powers protect—they do not expand authority.

## 12. Relationship to Other Documents

This document enforces the Ethical Product Charter, constrains the roadmap, governs the Decision Log, and protects Recovery & Behavioural Safety. When conflicts arise, user safety wins.

## 13. Review & Amendments

Amendments require logging, explicit reasoning, stronger or equivalent safeguards, and must never quietly weaken protections. User protection must increase or remain high.

## 14. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S is built on trust. Power over vulnerable people demands restraint, transparency, and humility. The founder is not above the system; the system exists to protect everyone—even from well-intentioned mistakes.
