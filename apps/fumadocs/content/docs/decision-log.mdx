## 1. Purpose

Codifies how major decisions are recorded so reasoning is preserved, debates aren’t repeated, pressure doesn’t cause drift, contributors gain context, and ethical intent survives growth. If it isn’t logged, it isn’t final.

## 2. What Counts as a Decision

Log anything affecting product/UX (feature inclusion, recovery changes, tone shifts, behavioural nudges), ethics/safety (monetisation, data, vulnerability handling, enforcement, AI), scope/roadmap (phase shifts, pulling/pushing features, removals), or governance (power distribution, oversight, partnerships, rule exceptions). When in doubt, log it.

## 3. Decision Log Rules

1. Record decisions when made, not retroactively.
2. “Why” outranks “what.”
3. Document rejected options to avoid future confusion.
4. Make ethical trade-offs explicit.
5. State reversibility and conditions for revisiting.

## 4. Decision Template

```
🧾 Decision Record

Decision ID:
Date (YYYY-MM-DD):
Decision Title:

1️⃣ Context
- What prompted this? Why now? Risks if left undecided?

2️⃣ Decision Made
- Clear, specific statement of the outcome.

3️⃣ Options Considered
- Option A — description, why considered, why rejected (if applicable)
- Option B — …

4️⃣ Alignment Check
- Reference relevant documents (Vision, Ethical Charter, Product Scope, Behavioural Safety, Recovery spec, etc.) and note any tension.

5️⃣ Ethical Considerations
- Risks, who could be harmed, pressure impacts, safeguards, why acceptable.

6️⃣ Impact Assessment
- Effects on users (especially vulnerable), complexity, maintenance, long-term trust.

7️⃣ Reversibility & Review
- Reversible? Under what conditions? What signals trigger reconsideration?

8️⃣ Owner & Reviewers
- Decision owner, contributors/reviewers, external input.

9️⃣ Final Notes
- Anything future readers should know.
```

## 5. Lightweight vs. Heavyweight Decisions

Lightweight items (UI spacing, copy tweaks, bug fixes) may compress the template but still require context, decision, and alignment. Heavyweight calls (monetisation, enforcement, behavioural nudges, data usage, recovery/risk flows) demand full detail across all template sections.

## 6. Reopening Decisions

Revisit only when new information appears, context changes materially, harm is observed, or legal/regulatory shifts demand it. Reopening requires a new record referencing the original and outlining what changed. History is extended, never erased.

## 7. Relationship to Other Documents

The log enforces the Ethical Product Charter, protects the roadmap, preserves intent behind the Feature Inventory, and supports governance. If a decision conflicts with another document, record the contradiction and mitigation.

## 8. Storage & Access

Keep the log versioned, searchable, and accessible to contributors—not hidden with leadership. Transparency builds internal trust.

## 9. Why This Matters

Products drift when memory fades, pressure mounts, and context disappears. The log slows us down just enough to stay honest and ethical.

## 10. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S relies on clarity, memory, accountability, and restraint. If a decision cannot be written calmly and ethically, it should not be made.
