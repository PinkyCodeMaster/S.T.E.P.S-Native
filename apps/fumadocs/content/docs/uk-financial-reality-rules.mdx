## 1. Purpose

Ensure calculations reflect lived UK reality, prevent false reassurance or panic, provide consistent explanations, and protect trust for Universal Credit households. When S.T.E.P.S cannot model something accurately it must say so, explain assumptions, and avoid false certainty—even if that slows delivery.

## 2. Universal Credit (UC)

### 2.1 Payment Timing

- UC is paid monthly on a claimant-specific date.
- If that date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment arrives earlier, never later.
- S.T.E.P.S must always show the accelerated payment date.

### 2.2 Income Composition

- UC can include standard allowance, child elements, housing element, and disability/other elements.
- Treat UC as one incoming payment while providing clear component breakdowns for explanation.
- Never assume landlord-directed housing funds are spendable.

### 2.3 Housing Element Handling

- Housing element may be paid to the claimant, directly to landlord (APA), or split.
- Landlord-paid housing element is informational only: display it, but exclude it from safe-to-spend.
- Claimant-paid housing element counts as income but is offset by the rent expense.
- Partial coverage highlights the remaining rent the claimant must cover.
- Always clarify which scenario applies.

### 2.4 Work Allowance & Taper

- Earnings up to the work allowance do not reduce UC; earnings above reduce UC by 55p per £.
- Calculations must be clearly labelled as estimates with configurable allowances.
- Never imply an official DWP determination; explain changes in plain English (e.g., “Your UC may be lower this month because earnings above your allowance reduce it by 55p per £.”).

## 3. Wages & Employment Income

### 3.1 Wage Timing

- Support monthly (often last working day), weekly, fortnightly, and four-weekly schedules.
- When a scheduled wage falls on a weekend or bank holiday, assume earlier payment unless users specify otherwise.
- Never default to late payment.

### 3.2 Variable Income

- Support fluctuating amounts, overtime, and irregular shifts.
- Default to user-entered values without smoothing.
- Clearly mark states as expected, confirmed, or paid.

## 4. Child Benefit

- Paid every four weeks and moves earlier for weekends/bank holidays.
- Amount depends on number of children.
- Calendar must reflect the four-weekly drift; never quietly convert to monthly. Explain the difference explicitly.

## 5. Child Maintenance

- Typically monthly but can be early or irregular.
- Treat as income with optional “reliability” tagging.
- Never assume payment unless confirmed.

## 6. Expenses & Bills

### 6.1 Essential vs Discretionary

- Essentials include rent, council tax, utilities, food, transport, minimum debt payments, service charges, and ground rent.
- Discretionary expenses include subscriptions, entertainment, and non-essential purchases.
- Users control classification; S.T.E.P.S may suggest but cannot override.

### 6.2 Rent & Housing Costs

- Rent may be weekly, monthly, or four-weekly; modelling must respect the chosen cadence.
- Service charges and ground rent are never assumed UC-covered and require separate tracking.
- Missed rent is always treated as high risk.

### 6.3 Retry Behaviour

- Many providers retry failed direct debits. S.T.E.P.S may warn of likely retries but must never guarantee timing or issue commands. Language stays advisory.

## 7. Debt Reality Rules

### 7.1 Priority

- Priority debts include CCJs, rent arrears, council tax arrears, and utilities with disconnection risk.
- CCJs override snowball ordering, and minimum payments on all debts must be respected before extra payments follow the user’s chosen strategy.

### 7.2 Fees, Interest & Admin

- Debts often accrue interest, admin fees, or enforcement costs.
- Do not assume balances drop linearly; explain when balances move unexpectedly and avoid blame.

## 8. Emergency Fund Reality

- Calculations use bare-minimum essentials, exclude landlord-paid rent, and include service charges/top-ups.
- Six months is guidance, not a requirement. Users can pause or skip without penalty.

## 9. Bank Holidays & UK Calendar Rules

- Always account for UK bank holidays, moving payments earlier and explaining why dates shift. Calendar accuracy is non-negotiable.

## 10. Legal & Advice Boundaries

- S.T.E.P.S is not regulated financial advice, cannot supersede professional debt advice, and must signpost external help with clear statements about limitations.

## 11. Transparency & Uncertainty

- When uncertainty exists, say “this is an estimate,” explain assumptions, and avoid false precision. Better to be slightly vague than confidently wrong.

## 12. Governance

- Any change affecting money calculations, UC logic, debt prioritisation, or housing treatment must reference this document, undergo careful review, and update user-facing copy accordingly.

## 13. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S serves real UK households, not idealised models. Accuracy builds trust, clarity reduces panic, and honesty protects users. When certainty is impossible, clarity is mandatory.
