## 1. Purpose

Clarifies S.T.E.P.S’ legal boundaries so users know what we provide, what we do not, where specialist help is required, and why honesty matters more than coverage.

## 2. What S.T.E.P.S Is (Legally)

S.T.E.P.S is a financial planning and support tool offering information, visualisation, organisation, explanations, and decision support. It does not make decisions, act on behalf of users, control/move money, or replace regulated services. Users remain responsible for their choices.

## 3. Financial Advice Boundary

### 3.1 No Regulated Advice

We do not provide regulated financial advice, personalised investment guidance, legal counsel, or FCA-regulated debt advice. Our content is educational, explanatory, and non-directive.

### 3.2 User Responsibility

Users decide how to act, which payments to prioritise, and when to seek professional advice. S.T.E.P.S supports decisions; it never replaces judgment.

## 4. Debt Advice & Enforcement Boundary

We do not negotiate with creditors, represent users legally, provide enforcement advice, or initiate legal action. We may explain concepts, suggest contacting creditors, offer templates, and signpost regulated debt advice. Signposting is support, not delegation.

## 5. Universal Credit & Benefits Boundary

S.T.E.P.S is not affiliated with DWP, does not make benefit decisions, and cannot guarantee outcomes. UC modelling is estimated from user inputs and labelled as non-official. Users should check official statements and treat S.T.E.P.S as a planning aid.

## 6. Estimates, Assumptions & Accuracy

We rely on estimates, projections, and assumptions. They must be labelled, explainable, and acknowledged as uncertain. We never present projections as guarantees or hide limitations.

## 7. Liability & Guarantees

S.T.E.P.S does not guarantee debt reduction timelines, avoidance of fees, benefit stability, payment success, or financial outcomes. External events lie outside our control; honesty preserves trust.

## 8. Third-Party Services & Links

Any referenced third-party service is clearly identified, with responsibility remaining on that provider. No implied endorsement exists unless stated. We never obscure third-party involvement or authority boundaries.

## 9. Future Regulated Activity

Introducing payment initiation, credit provision, debt consolidation, enforcement, or regulated debt advice requires proper authorisation, explicit compliance, document updates, and user notification. No regulated activity launches quietly.

## 10. Jurisdiction & Scope

S.T.E.P.S is designed for UK users, benefits, and rules. Use outside the UK may be inaccurate and is unsupported unless explicitly stated. Communicate this clearly.

## 11. Relationship to Other Documents

Supports Public Trust & Transparency, constrains roadmap expansion, protects against overreach, and reinforces ethical honesty. If a feature blurs legal boundaries, reconsider it.

## 12. User Communication Rule

Legal boundaries must be communicated calmly and clearly without fear or intimidation. Understanding beats legalese.

## 13. Review & Updates

Review whenever UK regulations shift, scope expands, or high-power features are proposed. Changes must be logged, explained, and communicated.

## 14. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S helps people navigate tough finances but never replaces professional services or oversteps authority. Clear boundaries protect everyone; if something is outside our role, we say so plainly.
