## Debt Snowball Rules

- Start with debts that create the most psychological relief (often letters/CCJs).
- Celebrate first contact, not full repayment.

## CCJ Override Logic

- If a CCJ or possession threat exists, it jumps to top of the plan regardless of balance.
- Provide scripts for set-aside, redetermination, or N244 applications.

## Minimum Payment Handling

- Highlight statutory or agreed minimums.
- Offer “if you can’t pay” branch with hardship templates.

## Hardship Expectations

- Encourage users to notify creditors before defaulting.
- Provide evidence packs (income proof, UC statements) to reduce friction.

## Future Methods (Flagged, Not Active)

- Community lending circles (research phase).
- Automated breathing space enrolment once regulations allow API integration.
