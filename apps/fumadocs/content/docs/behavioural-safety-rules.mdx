## 1. Purpose

Prevent manipulative or stress-inducing patterns from entering S.T.E.P.S, protect vulnerable users, keep engagement aligned with wellbeing, and provide an enforceable checklist. If a feature raises engagement but increases pressure, it does not ship.

## 2. Core Principle

Engagement must never rely on fear, shame, urgency, or loss aversion. Users must feel supported, informed, and in control—never watched, judged, rushed, or trapped.

## 3. Prohibited Dark Patterns

### 3.1 Fear-Based

- No countdown timers tied to money.
- No flashing alerts, panic colours, or simulated urgency.
- No “last chance/act now” messaging unless legally mandatory, and even then it must be factual, neutral, and explained.

### 3.2 Shame & Guilt

- No user comparisons, “you failed” states, red marks, or penalties for missed days.
- Never imply moral judgment (“you overspent,” “you failed,” “you’re behind”).

### 3.3 Loss Aversion & Penalties

- No threats to remove features, lock recovery tools, or warn “you’ll lose X.”
- Streaks cannot punish breaks or remove progress.

### 3.4 Manipulative Choice Architecture

- No hidden safer options, harmful defaults, misleading button hierarchy, disguised ads, or false binaries. Choices must be clear, equally visible, and reversible.

## 4. Allowed Patterns with Constraints

### 4.1 Notifications

- Must be informative, dismissible, limited in frequency, neutral in tone.
- Forbidden: escalation loops, repeated nudges post-dismissal, guilt messaging. Silence is acceptable.

### 4.2 Streaks & Progress

- Optional, cosmetic, non-punitive. Streaks never reset progress; missed days are neutral; recovery actions count positively.

### 4.3 Warnings & Risk Indicators

- Allowed only when based on real data, clearly explained, and paired with support actions. Never shame or overwhelm.

## 5. Consent & Control

- Irreversible actions require confirmation.
- Provide undo where possible, opt-out for non-essential features, user control over notifications, and clear exits from every flow. Control lowers anxiety.

## 6. Monetisation Safety

- No fear-based upsells, “upgrade to fix” messaging, crisis-time promotions, emotional targeting, or time-limited offers. Help is never contingent on payment.

## 7. Data & Behaviour Tracking Limits

- Tracking exists only to improve support, not to exploit vulnerability.
- Never infer emotional states for marketing, target users when stressed, or optimise for dependency.

## 8. Review & Testing

Any feature involving nudges, reminders, habit tracking, or progress indicators must pass a Behavioural Safety Review asking:

- Does this increase pressure?
- Could it cause guilt or shame?
- Does it punish disengagement?
- Does it reduce control?
- Would it feel safe during a bad week?

“Yes” answers require redesign.

## 9. Relationship to Other Documents

Enforces the Ethical Product Charter, complements UX Principles & Tone, constrains Roadmap decisions, and protects Recovery/Crisis flows. Passing roadmap review means nothing if behavioural safety fails.

## 10. Enforcement & Accountability

Applies to UI, copy, notifications, gamification, monetisation, and AI content. Violations must be documented, corrected, and reviewed. Repeated issues point to systemic failure.

## 11. Closing Statement

S.T.E.P.S reduces harm rather than optimising behaviour. If engagement requires manipulation, we choose disengagement. Trust is fragile; safety is deliberate.
