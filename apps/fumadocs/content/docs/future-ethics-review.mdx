title: Future Ethics Review
description: Hard gates for AI, banking, and consolidation expansions.

Survive Debt · Take Control · Establish Wealth · Protect Family · Secure Legacy

## 1. Purpose

Sets ethical conditions for any expansion into AI, open banking, or debt consolidation/creditor collaboration. These domains hold asymmetric power over vulnerable users. If a feature cannot satisfy this document, it must not exist.

## 2. Core Expansion Principle

Every future feature must feel safe to a stressed, tired user who is behind on bills and afraid. If the answer is “no,” do not proceed.

## 3. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### 3.1 Allowed Uses

AI may only explain information in plain English, summarise user-provided data, draft optional letters/messages, reduce cognitive load, and support understanding. AI assists; it never decides.

### 3.2 Prohibited Uses

- Making financial decisions.
- Overriding user judgement.
- Pressuring actions or simulating authority.
- Escalating consequences or assessing “risk” to gate help.
- Posing as an expert or replacing advice.

### 3.3 Transparency & Control

All AI usage must be clearly labelled, explain limitations, allow editing before use, remain optional/dismissible, and never operate invisibly. If users cannot understand what AI is doing, it is disallowed.

## 4. Open Banking & Financial Access

### 4.1 Preconditions

- Core product must work fully without banking integrations.
- Opting out must never disadvantage users.
- Manual alternatives must exist.
- Data access must be minimal and purpose-bound.

### 4.2 Read-Only Default

Integrations start as read-only: no payment initiation, no automated categorisation without review, no silent corrections. Users retain control.

### 4.3 Data Ethics

Financial data must never be sold, used for targeting, shared without explicit consent, or repurposed for monetisation. Trust cannot be transferred elsewhere.

## 5. Debt Consolidation & Creditor Collaboration

### 5.1 Power Shift Recognition

These features change S.T.E.P.S from supporting users against systems to potentially becoming part of the system. Extraordinary restraint is required.

### 5.2 Preconditions

- Obtain legal/regulatory guidance.
- Establish independent oversight.
- Codify hardship protections.
- Cap and disclose fees; no interest on principal.
- Guarantee exit without punitive consequences.
- Explicitly protect vulnerability.

If any condition is unmet, consolidation cannot proceed.

### 5.3 Fee & Cost Ethics

Total liability must be capped; fees cannot grow over time, appear on missed payments, or incentivise prolonged repayment. All costs disclosed upfront. Users must never pay more because life worsened.

### 5.4 Enforcement & Escalation

Any escalation must be rule-based, contextual, slow, explainable, avoidable, independently governed, and always offer re-engagement. Punishment is never default.

## 6. Conflict of Interest & Moral Hazard

Assess where S.T.E.P.S benefits financially, where users could be nudged toward S.T.E.P.S-friendly outcomes, how power imbalance shifts, and how trust might be exploited unintentionally. Reject any feature that profits from user hardship.

## 7. Ethical Review Process

Before AI/banking/consolidation features move forward, a formal ethics review must document:

- Who gains/loses power?
- Who bears risk?
- What happens when the user is struggling?
- Can users opt out without harm?
- Is it reversible?
- Would public scrutiny uphold it?

Record findings in the Decision Log.

## 8. User Communication & Consent

Users must understand what is changing, why, associated risks, and alternatives. Consent must be informed, explicit, and declinable without harm. No implied or bundled consent.

## 9. Relationship to Other Documents

This document extends the Ethical Product Charter, enforces Founder Safeguards, constrains the Roadmap, protects Behavioural Safety, and mandates Decision Log entries. If conflict arises, expansion stops.

## 10. Sunset & Exit Clauses

High-power features must provide clear exit paths, data deletion options, and reversibility where possible. Users must never feel trapped.

## 11. Closing Statement

Success increases temptation to overreach. Remember: just because we can does not mean we should. Handle earned trust with the gentlest hands possible.
