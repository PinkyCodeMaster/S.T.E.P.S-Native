description: Ensures recovery is calmer, safer, and always easier than avoidance.

Survive Debt · Take Control · Establish Wealth · Protect Family · Secure Legacy

## 1. Purpose

Defines how S.T.E.P.S supports users when something goes wrong. Recovery beats optimisation, engagement, or performance metrics. If a conflict arises, recovery wins.

## 2. Core Principles

1. **No Shame:** Never imply fault or irresponsibility.
2. **De-escalation First:** Calm before numbers or plans.
3. **Choice, Not Command:** Offer options, never orders.
4. **Containment Over Perfection:** Stop the bleed; perfection can wait.
5. **Recovery Is Progress:** Using recovery tools is a positive action.

## 3. Persistent Recovery Entry Point

- **Label:** “Something went wrong — help me fix it”
- **Visual:** Always visible, calm blue/green, rounded, never red or hidden.
- **Behaviour:** Pressing it never reduces streaks, triggers penalties, or escalates enforcement. It must feel safe at any time.

## 4. Initial De-escalation Screen

- **Title:** “It’s okay. We can sort this.”
- **Body Guidance:** “Money problems happen. You’re not in trouble, and this doesn’t undo your progress. Let’s just deal with the next step together.”
- **Design:** No numbers, warnings, charts, deadlines. Exactly one primary action: “Okay — what happened?”

## 5. One-Tap Context Selection

Options (emoji optional but consistent):

- ⏰ I missed a payment
- 📩 I got a letter or message
- 💸 Something cost more than expected
- 🧾 A bill might be taken again
- 😞 I’m overwhelmed and avoiding things
- ❓ Something else

Rules: no free-text requirement, no forced explanations, no severity ranking. A single tap progresses.

## 6. Context-Specific Flows

### 6.1 Missed Payment

- **Goals:** Reduce panic, prevent knock-on failures, offer realistic actions.
- **System:** Mark payment as neutral “missed,” recalc projections quietly, suppress cascading alerts.
- **User Options (max 3):** Contact provider, reschedule, adjust this month’s plan.
- **Tone:** “Missing one payment does not undo everything.”

### 6.2 Letter or Message

- **Goals:** Reduce fear, encourage engagement, prevent avoidance.
- **Flow:** Optional letter type selection, optional upload for safekeeping, plain-English reassurance.
- **Upload:** Optional, storage-first, no auto-interpretation or scary AI summaries.

### 6.3 Unexpected Cost

- **Goals:** Contain impact, prevent guilt, adjust safely.
- **Flow:** Ask rough amount range, adjust safe-to-spend quietly, highlight affected areas.
- **Language:** Never say “overspent” or “failure.”

### 6.4 Bill Retake Warning

- **Goals:** Prevent repeat failure, protect funds.
- **Flow:** Explain likely retry window, suggest keeping funds aside without commanding behaviour.
- **Copy Example:** “Keeping this money aside will likely prevent another issue.”

### 6.5 Overwhelm / Avoidance

- Immediate transition into Crisis Mode.

## 7. Crisis Mode

- **Purpose:** Support users when cognitive load is too high for normal planning.
- **Triggers:** User selects overwhelm, repeated recovery usage in short time, or manual activation.
- **Behaviour:** Hide non-essential UI, remove long-term goals and optimisation prompts, reduce notifications.
- **Visible Elements (max 3):** What is safe right now, what is urgent (if anything), next gentle step.
- **Exit:** User-controlled or suggested after calm period—never forced.

## 8. Phone Support Integration

- Offer click-to-call when helpful, never mandatory.
- Provide editable talking points (e.g., “I’m calling to deal with this early… Is there a way to reschedule or get some help?”).
- App supports confidence; it never speaks for the user.

## 9. System Behaviour Behind the Scenes

Upon recovery flow usage: pause non-essential notifications, avoid escalating language, recalc safely, preserve dignity, hide risk-score concepts. Safety logic stays invisible.

## 10. Closure & Containment

- **Title:** “Here’s where things stand now”
- **Summary:** What’s okay, what changed, what to expect next.
- **Final Action:** “That’s enough for today” to give explicit permission to stop.

## 11. Measurement & Success

Recovery succeeds when users re-engage, panic doesn’t escalate, mistakes don’t compound, and users feel supported. Metrics must never penalise recovery usage, rank compliance, or reward pressure tactics.

## 12. Governance

Any change to recovery/crisis behaviour must reference this spec, justify safety improvements, and undergo extra review. If stress increases, roll back immediately.

## 13. Closing Statement

Life is unpredictable; S.T.E.P.S refuses to punish people for being human. The recovery system asks only: “How can we help you fix this — calmly?”
