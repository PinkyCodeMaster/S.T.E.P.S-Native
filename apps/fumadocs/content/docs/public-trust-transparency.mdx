Survive Debt · Take Control · Establish Wealth · Protect Family · Secure Legacy

## 1. Purpose

State clearly what users can expect from S.T.E.P.S—without fine print. This is a public promise to earn trust, set expectations, prevent hidden behaviour, and support users during vulnerable moments.

## 2. Commitments to Users

### 2.1 We Will Not Shame You

We never blame, punish, or use guilt/fear/urgency. Debt is not a moral failure. You cannot be “bad” at money here.

### 2.2 Help Is Always Free

All core help, tools, and guidance stay free. Recovery is never paywalled. If optional paid services ever exist, they are clearly separated and never required for support.

### 2.3 Transparent About Money

If we charge anything, costs are upfront, totals plain, no hidden fees, no hardship penalties. You always know what you pay, why, and what you receive.

## 3. How We Use Data

### 3.1 Your Data Belongs to You

We never sell, share without consent, or use data for ads or stress-based targeting. Your information exists to help you.

### 3.2 Minimal, Purpose-Bound

We only collect what is necessary for planning, understanding, and recovery. If we don’t need it, we don’t ask.

### 3.3 Clear Explanations

We explain what data we use, why, what changes when you edit it, and how to remove it. No silent tracking or hidden analytics.

## 4. Transparency Around Decisions

### 4.1 No Silent Changes

Major changes are announced, rules are explained, and surprises are avoided. Anything affecting your money or experience gets communicated.

### 4.2 Honest Limits

We admit uncertainty, highlight estimates, and direct you to external advice when needed. We prefer “we’re not sure” over false confidence.

## 5. Handling Mistakes

When S.T.E.P.S gets something wrong, we acknowledge it, explain what happened, share the fix, and avoid blame-shifting. Mistakes are chances to rebuild trust.

## 6. User Control & Choice

Nothing irreversible occurs without confirmation. You can opt out, pause, or leave without penalty. Control is yours—including the right to walk away.

## 7. AI, Automation & Power

AI/automation will be clearly labelled, explain limitations, allow edits/overrides, and never decide for you. It aids understanding, not judgement.

## 8. Monetisation Boundaries

We will not push credit products, pressure upgrades, monetise vulnerability, or profit from slow recovery. Any revenue is ethical, explainable, and aligned with user benefit.

## 9. Accountability & Feedback

Questions, challenges, and criticism are welcome. We listen, respond with respect, and review concerns seriously. Trust grows through dialogue.

## 10. Enforcement

This promise is backed by the Ethical Product Charter, Behavioural Safety Rules, Decision Log, and Founder Safeguards. If we contradict this document, we are in the wrong.

## 11. Public Visibility

This document stays accessible in the app and on the website. Changes require notice and an explanation.

## 12. Closing Statement

Money stress is heavy enough. You should never wonder what S.T.E.P.S is doing or why. We earn trust slowly, honestly, and without shortcuts—and we stay on your side.
